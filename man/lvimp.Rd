\section{Imports}{

The packages that we import either make internal code nice
(dplyr, magrittr, tibble, rlang, data.table), or are used for estimating
and performing inference on cross-sectional variable importance (vimp).

We suggest several other packages: ggplot2 and cowplot help with plotting
variable importance estimates; testthat and covr help with unit tests;
and knitr and rmarkdown help with the vignettes and examples.
