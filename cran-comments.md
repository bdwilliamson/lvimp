## Initial submission

This is a resubmission of an initial submission. I have updated the DESCRIPTION and added \value tags of exported functions.

## Test environments:
* local windows-x86_64, R 4.4.0
* R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
* R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
* R-hub fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs; there was one NOTE, that I (Brian D. Williamson) am the package maintainer.

## Downstream dependencies
None.
