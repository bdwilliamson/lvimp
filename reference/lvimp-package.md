## Imports

The packages that we import either make internal code nice (dplyr,
magrittr, tibble, rlang, data.table), or are used for estimating and
performing inference on cross-sectional variable importance (vimp).

We suggest several other packages: ggplot2 and cowplot help with
plotting variable importance estimates; testthat and covr help with unit
tests; and knitr and rmarkdown help with the vignettes and examples.
